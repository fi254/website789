            <p><blockquote><blockquote> During my 3rd semester in diploma, there was a study syllabus for editing using Powerpoint, Gimp, and Inkscape software which it was a challenging yet still have sweet memories in it. During semester 3 break, I did fully live and work part time at home and manage household chores such as cooking, cleaning the house, managing the cats and managing my younger brother who is in primary school. One day, my father asked me to make a poster for a program organized by the office where my father works. At first I was hesitant to accept the offer, however I thought, why not I try to find new experience by applying the editing knowledge I have learned during semester 3. Definitely the poster I produced is definitely very concise and clear that it is the work of a "newbie" . The two posters above are among the 6 posters I have produced. However, surprisingly my father was satisfied and unexpectedly my father paid me RM50 for each poster I prepared. At that moment I realize that never regret. Victoria Holt once said <i><b>never regret what you are doing. If it is good, it is wonderful. if it is bad, it is experience.</b> </i></blockquote></blockquote></p>
